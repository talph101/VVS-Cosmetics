How You Built It
Technology focus was on the backend
Replaced backend with Java and Spring Boot, as well as MySQL.
Show wireframe and UML diagrams.
Part of what helps to communicate with the front end backend, this marks a class that handles HTTP requests and defines the starting endpoint for API calls related to 'items.'
The original database was H2 but switched to MySQL. Reason: H2 used in testing environments.
Talk about decisions you made (performance, scalability, flexibility, readability).
